= Massive Danger TSLint Config

Just a simple extension of the recommended TSLint config to suit my tastes.

== Changes from the Recommended rules

* Requires newline at end of file
* Interface names are never prefixed
* Member access is always explicit
* No namespaces
* No string literal access
* Object literal key quotes are only used as needed
* No object literal key sorting
* `catch`, `finally`, and `else` are on the same line as the preceding braces
* String templates are prefered for concatenation, but simple, two-string concatenation is allowed
* Single quotes are used, but escaping should be avoided
* No semicolons ever
* Always put spaces before function definitions
* No trailing commas
